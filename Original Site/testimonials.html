			<h1>What Our Customers Say About Us</h1>
<h2>Richard Gladden – President of Data Vault</h2>
<p>
	We have been a client of Varitech for several years since they installed a backup generator at our business. Everything in our business relationship has been handled professionally and expediently, from the initial installation to subsequent regular preventative maintenance calls. In fact, when we experienced an uncommon problem with the generator, Varitech was tenacious in finding a satisfactory resolution. Great folks!
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>PC in Middletown</h2>
<p>
	In August, 2004,Varitech installed a 7Kw Generac unit to power household essentials during outages. I was impressed with Mr. Brown's attention to details during the quote process and in the installation, his concern for customer satisfaction, and in the consistently maintained level of professionalism. This standard was maintained for the next 6 years, so much so that I then upgraded to a 14Kw whole house unit. For the past 2 years, that new unit's performance and service have lived up to the high standards I expected.
</p>
<p>
	I would recommend Greg Brown and Varitech to anyone considering a standby generator for their home. The Generac unit has been a godsend during the week-long power outages caused by past wind and ice storms. When you have electricity (lights, heat, cooling), the purchase may seem something to "think about" -- when you're in the dark, with food spoiling in the refrigerator, and enduring whatever temperature Mother Nature is throwing at you, it proves itself to be a necessity.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Troy Wright -Director of Maintenance at Highlands Nursing and Rehab</h2>
<p>
	For the two plus years that I&rsquo;ve been at Highlands, Varitech has been taking care of our emergency generator. The staff is helpful with any question I may have and the company as a whole have always been fast to respond to any and all emergency that we've had.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Sandy Rose, Shop Manager at Filmwerks International Inc.</h2>
<p>
	I would like to say that Varitech went above and beyond helping us on two different projects for the golf productions going on in their area. The first project required expediting parts as well as service and they made our problem theirs and DONE!
</p>
<p>
	The second was going the extra mile with taking apart a generator end on two different units to make the one in place run. This incurred after hour support and again the problem was handled.
</p>
<p>
	My experience all over North America is that good company&rsquo;s like this should not go unpraised, and highly recommended for our next time or anyone else . very professional and billing was a smooth process.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Jim Ryan – Jeffersontown, KY</h2>
<p>
	The generator has done a great job. It has kicked in when we needed it &amp;removed a bunch of pressure when we have had storms. The service has been terrific.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Rob Furlong - Louisville, KY</h2>
<p>
	Varitech installed a natural gas powered 7 KW Core Power unit at my residence in June 2011. The unit was installed in a workmanlike manner by the obviously skilled and experienced Varitech personnel. We have had 3 separate power outages since installation and the unit has performed perfectly. I was out of town during the most recent outage, and my wife said she didn't even realize there was a power failure until she heard the unit. I definitely recommend the Generac unit and the guys at Varitech for installation and service.....
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>DTJ – Prospect, KY</h2>
<p>
	We have used Varitech for several years to service our built-in generator. They have always been highly professional, punctual and responsive. I highly recommend them with an "A" rating.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>JH – Anchorage, KY</h2>
<p>
	My husband and I are pleased to have the opportunity to tell Varitech how happy we are with our GE whole house generator that was installed last year. First, we are relieved from the worry of having to deal with power outages which we have experienced in the past. Our home is located in a heavily treed area that contributed to loss of power on a regular basis, sometimes lasting over a week. Our experiences have not been pleasant. Second, we are so relieved of this worry that we no longer even think about having to deal with power outages. Evaluation of our needs was excellent, installation was handled professionally, and the little blue light and the weekly test tell us we have ongoing protection. We are totally satisfied with our investment and our ongoing relationship with Varitech.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Tom Weber</h2>
<p>
	In October 2011 we contracted with Varitech to install a 10kW Briggs and Stratton generator. We had shopped around quite a bit, but decided on Varitech because of the way Greg Brown explained the way the unit would operate. The purchase was very low pressure. We were able to use our own electrician for that part of the installation. The Varitech installers were very professional and completed the job with no mess to clean up.
</p>
<p>
	We did have one minor problem when the unit did not start on the weekly test. I called and the problem was resolved the same day!
</p>
<p>
	I would recommend Varitech to anyone who is interested in having a generator installed!
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>RS – Louisvillle, Ky</h2>
<p>
	We have had Varitech service our generator for 5 years. The company has been dependable and professional.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Randy – Prospect, KY</h2>
<p>
	We purchased from Varitech a new 14KW Generac generator in 2009. We've had it serviced each year by Varitech. Professional customer service, honesty, and reasonable pricing are the best attributes that encompass my experiences with Varitech. I am a satisfied customer since 2009.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Bob Duley – Director Plant Operations at Central State Hospital</h2>
<p>
	Presently I am extremely satisfied with the service and professionalism that the Varitech Company has done. Over the past couple of years Varitech has done PMs on are 8 Generators (Onans/Caterpillars) also the recently performed some repairs and load bank tests and again did a great job at a reasonable price. I highly recommend the Varitech Company.
</p>
<h2>L.Bryant</h2>
<p>
	My name is L. Bryant, and after going through the wind storm and ice storm of 2008 I did not want to go through that again. Not only because of not having power, hot water, and the loss of food, but also for safety reasons. During these outages there were home invasions, looting, etc. I contacted several companies, including one that I met at the KY State Fair, and made my decision to go with Varitech. I was very impressed with Varitech, and Greg Brown. I did not feel pressured to make a decision; I did not have to deal with a high pressure sales person. I was dealing with a professional company that knew their business because generators are their business. I was also dealing with a good person that did not try to talk over my head, and I appreciated that. When my generator a GE 10kw was installed the gentleman that installed it did a great job, as do all of their employees that service my generator twice a year. I have had to use my generator several times during storms or other type of outages in the area and have been very comfortable, and safe. I can't say enough about my generator or Varitech. I would recommend Varitech to anyone looking to invest in a back-up generator and the company to go with. I have recommended them to my friends, co-workers, and most recently a real-estate agent. I know that if I ever move from my current home that a back-up generator from Varitech with be one of the first things that will done before or immediately after moving in.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Steve Meschede</h2>
<p>
	After a loss of power for extended periods of time on several occasions, I started a search online into natural gas generators. Greg from Varitech responded promptly and set up an appointment to come by and listen to my concerns and give recommendations. He e-mailed a quote the next day or two. I also got a quote from an electrician that had installed a generator for two family members. Greg's quote was a lot less expensive and it was from a company that specializes in generator sales and installations. Varitech installed a Briggs &amp; Stratton 12kW generator and switch box in October, 2011. Installation went great service was scheduled for six month check-up. I received an email at six month .Varitech came and serviced unit at scheduled time on time. Have had one short term power outage since installation; equipment worked flawlessly. Could not be more pleased and the peace of mind is worth the price.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>JC – Louisville, KY</h2>
<p>
	My experience with Varitech was excellent. The natural gas backup generator was selected, installed, and placed in operation without any problems. I believe the pricing was fair and the service excellent. I would recommend this company without reservation and will certainly use Varitech in the future. It was a very positive experience for this important investment for my home.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>SL – Prospect, Ky</h2>
<p>
	Greg &amp; Varitech do a great job. The main reason for having a generator is to back you up when there is a problem, the last thing you need is your safety net to go down too. Greg and his team are well prepared to give you confidence, that your back-up won&rsquo;t back-down.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Tim &amp; Kathleen Whitaker</h2>
<p>
	In March of this year, we had a standby generator installed by Varitech. We had shopped around and were to the point of making a decision as to who we wanted to install the unit. After having Greg out to see what/where we wanted our generator, I asked him a lot of questions regarding codes and installation procedures. I wanted to be safe and I am detail oriented having spent @30 years in commercial construction myself. I told my wife after he left that He had answered all my questions exactly the way I would have wanted them answered. We had talked to a couple of other contractors but were not at peace with the impressions they made. The installation was fast, efficient and clean. Everyone that came into our home was very conscientious of what they were doing. They came with everything they needed and did everything they were supposed to do and in a manor I was completely satisfied with. The generator cycles weekly as it is supposed to and has been called upon on one occasion after the last big storm we had. It ran eleven hours one night which meant that I wasn't out hooking up my gasoline powered generator so my sump pump would run (@one-----two hour intervals). Needless to say, we are very happy with the equipment (G.E. natural gas powered generator), it has already been worth the investment. We realize now that we can go on vacation without worrying about the power going off!
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Rob at Unique Management</h2>
<p>
	Unique Management has worked with Varitech for all our generator needs since at least 2007. Greg has been a tremendous resource in terms of helping us find the appropriate solutions we need for our business. The latest system they installed is a Generac 80kW Natural Gas powered generator with an automatic transfer switch. Greg managed the full installation, which went very smoothly. Any maintenance issues are always addressed in extremely prompt fashion. We are extremely satisfied with Varitech!
</p>
<h2>Steve Bass of Mockingbird Gardens</h2>
<p>
	&ldquo;Greg, thank you for your continued great customer service since 2008. After so many electric outages and my concern over my wine cellar being without cooling you came to the rescue.
</p>
<p>
	I now can relax regardless of what kind of storm is approaching…except a tornado hitting our house. I also appreciate the yearly maintenance that you perform to make sure we have no issues when the time arises. Thank you and your crew!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>BR – Louisville, KY</h2>
<p>
	Greg, it is my pleasure to recommend Varitech. You, your company, and your associates have been a pleasure to work with, from the very first meeting to today. You returned my initial phone call promptly. You met with me promptly. You were well prepared. You took time to educate me and answer all my many questions. Your pricing was fair and reasonable, and you offered alternatives which I certainly hadn&rsquo;t considered, saving me money in the process. The office team has always been there to help with questions. The installation team, working with the electrician I recommended, was efficient and professional. And your follow up after installation was excellent. How many more positive things can I say? I would recommend you to all.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>GS – Radcliff, KY</h2>
<p>
	I have used the services of Varitech for three years. They are contracted to service my standby generator at my home. I can only say that the service has been excellent. My generator has received annual serving three times, and I have found Varitech to be responsive to all my needs. I had one malfunction which was quickly taken care of. I was initially concerned that Varitech is located in Louisville and I live in Radcliff, but this has not been a problem. Varitech's pricing is competitive. Their service personnel are quite capable and quick to respond. I would recommend Varitech to anyone putting in a standby generator at their home.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Joy and David Rhodes</h2>
<p>
	Greg Brown with Varitech, Inc. installed a 10 K W generator (GE) with automatic transfer at our home in January 2011. We have been very pleased with the professional workmanship as well as the quality of equipment. We have a great sense of relief, now that we have the automatic generator. It works very efficiently and effectively. Since the installation, our power has been out only two times, but the generator automatically kicked on within seven seconds following each outage. We have an excellent business relationship with Greg and his representatives, and we would certainly recommend Varitech, Inc. for your generator needs.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Pete Blandford</h2>
<p>
	I am very happy with the backup generator from Varitech. Their installation was done in a very prompt and professional manner and the service afterwards is top notch.
</p>
<h2>Cliff Burnstein - Louisville, KY</h2>
<p>
	A sudden down turn in my wife's respiratory disease made a standby generator mandatory. Selecting the right company and the right generator can be so difficult. To me, it&rsquo;s a matter of trust. I had clipped an attractive coupon from Varitech in some publication last year and fortunately kept it. I connected with Greg Brown, who was right on time for an appointment at my home. He patiently discussed generator and accessory selection, gained my trust, and helped me make MY decision. Because of the medical needs, I selected a GE 17KW. A smaller generator may have sufficed, but the peace of mind and relatively small difference in cost made the selection easy. Greg did all the ordering and coordinating, and provided a team of Varitech professionals who did the job right. I cannot say enough positives about Greg Brown and the Varitech team. Great job, thanks so much.
</p>

<h2>Satisfied Customer from Louisville/Lexigton, KY</h2>
<p>
	We used Varitech to install our GE generator at our home in Louisville last summer and were so pleased that when we moved to the Lexington area this past year, we had them install a GE generator at our new home.  They do a great job upfront in advising on which GE product best fits your needs and provide an accurate cost estimate.  Both of our installations were performed very professionally and the generator is very reliable and unobtrusive in the home&rsquo;s landscaping.  We would not hesitate to use Varitech again or recommend them to others.
